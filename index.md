## Introduction
### Data and Data source
The dataset analyzed in this project is the “Chicago Crime Incidents 2001 to Present”, sourced by Harshdeep Sharma on the website Kaggle, extracted from the Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. This data represents a public record of reported incidents of crime (excluding murders, where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the city of Chicago. The dataset is quite extensive, comprising approximately 8 million records with very few instances of missing data. Each record represents a distinct incident and includes key variables, such as the date and time of the occurrence, block-level address, crime type (following IUCR codes), location description (street, residence), arrest status, and domestic classification. Crucially for our spatial analysis, the data includes latitude and longitude coordinates for the majority of incidents.


### Research Questions
This analysis attempts to answer two questions regarding the evolution of crime in Chicago:
* How have the geographic locations (“Hotspots”) of crimes changed from year to year?
* Has there been a significant change in the overall volume and specific types of crimes (“Trends”) committed over the years?
With the first question, we aim to observe if crime remains concentrated in specific neighborhoods or if it fluctuates due to other confounding variables. With the second question, we aim to identify trends in the most frequently reported crimes and observe how their prevalence has changed over the two decades.


### Data Sources/Ideas
* [Allrecipes](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-09-16): Find top ingredients by avrage star rating and then possibly make something combinding the top 5?
* [Henley Passport Index Data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-09-09): Compaire strenghts of passports baised on year and compair with global events to see how that impacted raitings
* [Pixar Films](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-03-11): See if there actually has been a fall off of pixar films in the recent years using 5 ratings and release dates
* [The CIA World Factbook](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-10-22/readme.md): Observe the relationship between many variables of a country
* [Relative Age of Congress](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-demographics): Compaire how the avrage age of congress compairs to the avrage age of consituants over time.
